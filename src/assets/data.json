        "As a creative and innovative software developer, I am well versed in technology and writing codes to create solutions for systems that are reliable and efficient. I elevate the performance through softwares by self learning and using the skills I already obtained through my software engineering bootcamp. The importance of providing clear and concise information coincides with requiring excellent oral, coding and written communication skills which I obtained. I am highly skilled in full-stack development with experience in both front-end and back-hand technologies. My experience in architecture allows me to showcase my creativity and strengthen my user-friendly designs. With my previous background and experiences combining continuous learning and problem solving skills it has ensured that I have advanced my knowledge. This is something that I will continue to progress further through self development and any training and experience if required for the job. I have great enthusiasm towards my work and take pride in making sure that every task is completed under excellent review. Understanding the importance of keeping all customers satisfied. I have been and will continue to go above and beyond for all work endeavors."

        "I come from architecture background with 2 years of experience. Architecture have been my passion since I was a little kid. Building complex structures with smaller and simpler components, creating places and tools for world's best give me fulfillment that I need from a job. My professional ethics are extremely strong due to the education I received. I did my best within the limits given to me by my skills and ethics for the benefit of the customers I worked for, and the feedback I received was always positive. I have completed successful projects by understanding my customers' ideas and perspectives by empathizing with them, and then combining their ideas with the knowledge and creative talent I have acquired so far. I found software engineering similar to architecture. In today's age of technology, where every profession evolves with technology, I could not help but find myself in this sector. I believe with my architectural background, I bring high valued transferable skills to the table. "
